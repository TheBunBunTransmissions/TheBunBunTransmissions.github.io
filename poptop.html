That's the sound a popcorn ceiling makes when you scrape it with a  stick.

The sound is a big part of the appeal . That's why many seek drywall and ceiling even if it's hard to find. My cousin once had a bit of popcorn ceiling. It was a bit aged and yellowing but still in good condition. we would spend our off time taking the sturdiest stick we could find and slowly dragging it across the chunk of ceiling, watching bits of plaster break off. The breaks in plaster are, in my opinion, one of the funnest parts. They remind me of those earth candies my uncle used to sneak to me at family gatherings. Soft, crunchy and would melt in your mouth. I often feel sad at the  loss of earth, even though I had never visited. It makes finding popcorn ceiling exponentially harder, let alone making the stuff. I see scavengers in magazines  finding huge chunks of ceiling on the surface of earth, or if they're lucky a whole ceiling. Roof and everything. It's one of my dreams to be able to  go down there and find some myself.  Popcorn ceilings are truly a wonderful thing.

Will be updating soon love you guys!</p>
